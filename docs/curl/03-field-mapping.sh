# Issue a search-and-cluster request with a more complex field mapping.
#
# Note the search_request part is a regular search request; it contains
# highlighter directives; the number of fragments and fields to be highlighted
# are configurable.
#
# In order to make sense for clustering, it must (should) 
# fetch at least 100 documents.
#
# The "query_hint" part provides query-like terms that the clustering algorithm
# takes into account to avoid creating trivial clusters.
#
# The "field_mapping" section maps logical "document" fields (title, content) to
# the indexed document's title field and a highlighted (typically shorter content)
# fragment of "content" field.
