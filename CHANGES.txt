================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 7.6.0 ====================

Backward-incompatible changes

* Upgrade of Carrot2 to 4.0.0-beta3. This results in a number of backward-incompatible
  changes to the plugin.

  1) The local field for URL (and the corresponding mapping) is gone without replacement.
  2) Names of clustering algorithms have changed. They are now (note white space):
     Lingo, STC, Bisecting K-Means, Lingo3G (optional, commercial)
  3) The language field is no longer a two-letter code. The list of supported languages
     depends on the algorithm and availability of resources and is printed at startup;
     (service extension points are used to load algorithms and languages).
  4) Names and structure of attributes for clustering algorithms have changed. They reflect
     the new, updated Carrot2 API, see:
     https://carrot2.github.io/release/4.0.0-beta3/doc/rest-api-reference/
  5) Algorithm suites and predefined component descriptors (in XML) have been removed and
     are no longer supported. Algorithms are loaded via service extensions.
  6) There are two new request attributes: "language" specifying default clustering
     language for documents that don't declare it explicitly and "create_ungrouped" which
     forces the plugin to create a synthetic group with unclustered document references
     (this corresponds to "other topics" group from previous Carrot2 versions).
  7) Nearly all plugin options have been removed. The single option remaining is "resources"
     with an array of ES configuration folder-relative locations where algorithm resources
     are looked up.
  8) Default lexical resources from Carrot2 are included under configuration folder and
     used by default.

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 7.5.0 ====================

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 6.5.4 ====================

Other changes

* Build updates to ES 6.5.4.

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 6.4.3 ====================

Other changes

* Build updates to ES 6.4.3.

* Permit custom resource lookup location for each algorithm. This can be accomplished
  by declaring a 'esplugin.resources' attribute inside a given component's configuration
  attributes. For example, changing lingo-attributes.xml in the following way:

  <attribute-set id="overridden-attributes">
    <value-set>
      <label>overridden-attributes</label>
      <attribute key="esplugin.resources">
        <value value="lingo-resources"/>
      </attribute>
    </value-set>
  </attribute-set> 

  would cause all algorithm resources to be read from:
  
  {es-home}/config/elasticsearch-carrot2/lingo-resources

Bug Fixes

* GH-4: Compatibility issue with elasticsearch-0.90.10

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 1.2.0 ================

New Features

* Added an action to return all available clustering algorithms.

* Added support for search-and-cluster requests using HTTP GET (with a subset
  of all the functionality but still useful).

Bug Fixes

* Proper propagation of ProcessingExceptions from Carrot2 framework (in case
  they happen due to, for example, invalid attribute values).

Other

* Added tests for invalid attribute values and proper responses in such
  case (API, REST).

* Refactoring of API classes (nesting classes under ClusteringAction, similar pattern
  will follow for all future *Action implementations).

* Improved tests (test requests are converted to all XContentTypes).

* Restructured the plugin documentation, added table of contents and 
  sections for each REST API method.

* Minor touches for incompatible ES API changes (removed methods in RestActions).

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 1.1.1 ================

Other

* Minor touches for incompatible ES API changes (removed methods in RestActions).

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 1.1.0 ================

New features

* The size of the clustering controller's component pool is adjustable using
  the configuration file (controller.pool-size option).  

* Added language field mapping descriptors. This helps with multi-lingual 
  clustering -- hints about each document's language can be stored together
  with the document in the index. See the documentation for examples.

Bug Fixes

* GH-1: Front-page example visualizations fail with Lingo3G.

Other

* Update base ES dependency to 0.90.2

* Verified threading (clustering runs on the search thread), added 
  simple stress testing.

* Added information about search threadpool use and potential tweaks to 
  its default size to examples.html

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 1.0.1 ================

Bug Fixes

* GH-1: Front-page example visualizations fail with Lingo3G.

================ ElasticSearch-Carrot2 1.0.0 ================

First open source release.
